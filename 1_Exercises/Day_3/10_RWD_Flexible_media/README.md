## Exercise done with the lecturer

### Inserting images (~ 5min - 10min)

In `index.html` you will find a section with `images` class. Insert an image in it (rabbit.png) in the two following ways:
* using an **img** tag,
* as a background for a **div** element.

Do it in such a way that on a computer screen both images are displayed side by side and each has **50%** of screen width. On a tablet screen one image should be displayed under the other (each having **100%** of screen width).
Use your knowledge and set the styles in such a way that both images are rescaled when the browser window is shrinked.

## Exercises to do on your own

### Exercise 1. Inserting image 1 (~ 2min - 7min)

In `index.html` you will find a section with `one-image` class. Set its width, height and border. Next, insert rabbit.png in it using the `img` tag so that it takes 100% of the parent element. Can you see any problems? Wrote them in a comment in the HTML file.
