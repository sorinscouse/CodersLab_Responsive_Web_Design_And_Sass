## Exercises to do on your own

### Exercise 1. Navigation for a page  (~ 15min - 20min)

Create a working "hamburger" navigation for the page from the previous exercise. On mobile screens a "hamburger" icon should be visible (in the top left corner), and navigation elements should show when it is clicked. On tablet and desktop screens the hamburger icon should be hidden - usual navigation should be displayed instead.

Remember that navigation should always work the same way, even when the width of the browser window is adjusted.

Use matchMedia.
