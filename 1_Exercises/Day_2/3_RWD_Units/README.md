# RWD &ndash; Units in RWD

> Remember to separate exercises with comments and to write legible, well formatted code.

## Exercise done with the lecturer

### Different font sizes  (~ 5min - 10min)

In `index.html` you will find a section named `test`. Test how `px`, `rem`, `em` and `%` units work, setting font size for individual elements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Exercises to do on your own

### Exercise 1 (~ 2min - 7min)

In `index.html` you will find a section named `panel` with a paragraph filled with text.
Set font size for the section to 40px, and make the font of the paragraph half the size of the section font size.
Use em unit.

### Exercise 2 (~ 5min - 10min)

In `index.html` you will find a section with `bg_box` class that contains a `div` with `box` class.
Set the font size of the `box` to `2em`. Set its width (also using `em`) in such a way that the calculated `width` equals `60px`.

### Exercise 3 (~ 2min - 7min)

In `index.html` you will find a section with `container` class with a paragraph element in it.
Set font size of the paragraph to `3rem` in such a way that it equals `24px`.

### Exercise 4 (~ 5min - 10min)

In `index.html` you will find a section with `container` class that contains an element with `wolf_text` class.
Set the border and width of this element in such a way that the calculated width equals `240px`. Use `rem` units.

### Exercise 5 (~ 2min - 7min)

In `index.html` you will find a section with `winnie_the_pooh` class containing a `blockquote` element.
Set the font size of this element to `300%` in such a way that the calculated size equals 30px.

### Exercise 6 (~ 5min - 10min)

In `index.html` you will find a section with `images` class containing an element with `img_one` class.
Using `background-image`, set a background for the `img_one` element. (You will find cat.jpg image in the images directory).
Set the width of the whole section to 80%, and border so that the borders of this element are visible.
The element with the image should take `30%` of this section.

### Exercise 7 (~ 2min - 7min)

Put a part of the section with `images` class in a comment. What is the width of the element with the image now?
Write your observations in a comment.

### Exercise 8 (~ 2min - 7min)

In `index.html` you will find a section with `test_height_grandpa` class with nested `div` elements.
Set borders in different colors for all elements. Next, set '50px' height for an element with `test_height_grandpa` class, and twice as big height for the `test_height_daddy` element.
Use the percentage unit.

The element with `test_height_baby` class should have the same height as the element with `test_height_grandpa` class - use the percentage units.

### Exercise 9 (~ 2min - 7min)

Put the height of the element with `test_height_daddy` class (from the previous exercise) in a comment. Write in a comment your observations.

### Exercise 10 (~ 2min - 7min)

In `index.html` you will find a `h1` element in the section with `centered_text` class.
Using viewport units, place the `h1` element in the center (both vertically and horizontally).
