# Sass - Maps

> Remember to separate exercises with comments and to write legible, well formatted code.

## Exercise done with the lecturer

### 1. List and map (~ 5min - 10min)

Create a simple list containing three different colors. Set them as background colors for: `body`, `header` and `section` with `main-width` class. Next, create a map containing three different width values. Set these widths for: `body`, `header` and `section` with `main-width` class.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Exercises to do on your own

### Exercise 1. Map (~ 5min - 10min)

Create a map with five colors of your choice. Use it to set background color for the page, the text, and the footer.

### Exercise 2. Map (~ 2min - 5min)

Create a map with two different width values, e.g.

`$map: (
    min-width: 200px,
    max-width: 1000px
);`

Next, using an appropriate function, create a list of values from that map.
Remember that in SASS functions always return the result of the operation.
Assign the result of the appropriate function to a variable.
Next, set the first element of the newly created list as the width of the elements with ```menu``` class.
