# Sass - Basics

> Remember to separate exercises with comments and to write legible, well formatted code.

## Exercise done with the lecturer

###  Source code maps  (~ 2min - 7min)
Generate sourcemaps for your **scss** file and test how it works in the browser.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Exercises to do on your own

### Exercise 1. Formatting output styles  (~ 2min - 7min)
Test different ways of formatting output styles
* nested,
* expanded,
* compact,
* compressed.

Which one suits you best? What are its advantages and disadvantages?
Place your answer in the ```scss/main.scss``` file.

### Exercise 2. Comments  (~ 2min - 7min)
Add both types of comments to the **scss** file and check which ones are compiled to CSS, and which are not.

### Exercise 3. Variables  (~ 5min - 10min)
* Define two variables that will store main colors of the page.
* In the **index.html** file there is a **ul** list with ```menu``` **class**. Change the color of text in it to one of the defined main colors. Give the header the same color.
* Add another variable in which you will define top and bottom padding. Set padding for **section** elements.
