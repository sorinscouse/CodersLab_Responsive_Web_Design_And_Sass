# Sass - Installing and initializing
> You can use gulp to compile, or compile with Ruby.


## Exercises done with the lecturer

### Exercise 1. Creating a project (~ 5min - 10min)
* In **index.html** file add a **h1** with text, e.g.  „Hello, Sassy!” and open the file in the browser.
* Create a directory named **scss**, and create a **main.scss** file in it. The file should contain a header color and a background color for the entire page. Best if the header will be visible.
* Load the generated style sheet in **index.html** (with an appropriate extension).
* Compile the Sass file in a known way (e.g. using Gulp).
* Check if an appropriate catalog with the **css** file was generated.
* Refresh the page in the browser.
* Change the header color in the **scss** file and refresh the page once more.

### Exercise 2. .gitignore (~ 2min - 5min)

Explain how the .gitignore file works if it is set to ignore the node_modules catalog among others.
Explain why this catalog should not be added to the repository.

## Exercises to do on your own

### Exercise 1. Overwriting changes (~ 2min - 5min)
Change header color and add a property, e.g. margin directly in the generated **css** file. Check the changes in the browser. Go to the **scss** file and make any change other than the one you made in the **css** file, e.g. padding. Save the file and check the result both in the generated **css** file, and in the browser. What has changed?
