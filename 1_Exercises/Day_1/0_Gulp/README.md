## Exercises to do on your own

### Exercise 1. Installing Gulp (~ 60min - 90min)

Install gulp using npm. Create a gulpfile.js file. Create a task in it that will allow you to compile Sass files to CSS. Create an appropriate watcher that will watch changes not only in one file, but the entire ```scss``` directory.
