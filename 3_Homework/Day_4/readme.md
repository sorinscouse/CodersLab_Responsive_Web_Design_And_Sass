# Sass & RWD - homework

### Day 4

#### Exercise 1. Bootstrap

As a beginner front-end developer you must get used to constant learning and to developing your skills constantly. Technologies and languages change. It is important to be aware of that and to follow those changes.
In reference to the introduction, take a look at the page: http://getbootstrap.com/examples/grid/
Test it. How do the columns scale themselves?
Next, go to the page http://getbootstrap.com/ , download appropriate files :) and add them to the project.
When you have added bootstrap to your project, try to:
* create several columns using any bootstrap classes,
* create several headers, e.g. `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, etc.,
* create several buttons and add any bootstrap classes to them,
* create a sample layout http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#template

#### Exercise 2. Revise the material :)
